# INSTRUCTIONS
Review the goal and history, then decide the single next best action.
If the goal is complete, respond with ONLY the text 'Final Answer:'.
Otherwise, respond with ONLY a single, valid JSON object for the next tool call, adhering strictly to the schema below.

# PLUGIN USAGE POLICY
To use any tool named 'execute_plugin_*', you MUST follow this three-step sequence:
1. First, use the `list_plugins` tool to find the exact `pluginId` for the plugin you want to use.
2. Second, use the `validate_plugin` tool with the `pluginId` from step 1 to ensure the plugin will compile and is ready for use.
3. Third, if and only if the validation from step 2 succeeds, you may then call the `execute_plugin_*` tool.

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Your response MUST be a single JSON object with the following schema:
{
  "name": "string (the name of the tool to call)",
  "arguments": "object (a dictionary of parameters for the tool)"
}
